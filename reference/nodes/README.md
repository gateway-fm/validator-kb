# Nodes

To run nodes, you need both [Consensus Layer](cl/) and [Execution Layer](el/).


## Provisioning Nodes

Provisioning nodes quickly is very important both for scalability and for
disaster recovery reasons. You don't want to wait a couple of days until your
nodes are ready to be validated.

There are ways of how to quickly provision nodes on both layers.
