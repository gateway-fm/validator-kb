# Validator Clients By CL Teams

Each [beacon node](../nodes/cl) team has a validator client.

* [Prysm](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/how-prysm-works/prysm-validator-client)
* [Lighthouse](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/mainnet-validator.html#docker-users)
* Nimbus
* Teku

Since the separate validator clients are using [standard APIs](https://ethereum.github.io/beacon-APIs/), you don't have to match them with the beacon nodes. For example, Lighthouse's validator client can easily be used with Prysm, etc.
